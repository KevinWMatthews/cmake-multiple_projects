Pulling initial idea from here:
    https://github.com/svenstaro/minimal-examples/tree/master/cmake-multiple-projects-flat

Results so far:
    All high-level targets appear in make autocomplete/tab completion.
    Can cd into each project and run make from there.
    This provides the option to make the defualt target as well as individual source files (!).
        The latter is not useful for a large project.
    Running 'make clean' in project2 cleans the library.
